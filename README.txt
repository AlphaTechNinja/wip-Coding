this coding language is similar
to assembly but it is built on
librarys at every start of a program
put "lib wip/addons" that will include
all basic librarys also this has
some more advanced librarys
heres a list they are all in
"wip/extras":
name:fs
description:adds the filesystem to the coding language
path:"wip/extras/fs.lua"
-------------------------------
name:graphics
description:adds a basic pixel place function
requirements:CraftOS-PC
path:"wip/extras/graphics.lua"
-------------------------------
name:term
description:adds the terminal to the coding language
path:"wip/extras/term.lua"

How to install
ok so now a installer exist to install run command "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlphaTechNinja/wip-Coding/OpenComputers edition/install.lua wipInstall.lua"
and run file "wipInstall.lua" to download then your all set also if you are on a server with no http then i will try to turn it into a single copy and paste string, to update delete file wipInstall.lua then rerun install command and run the file again also delete the existing "wip" so there arent any overwrite errors

--UPDATE
When i release AlphaOS this is going to be a included tool with the default system utils
